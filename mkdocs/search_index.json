An App ID is used to identify one or more of your apps. It can be an \nexplicit App ID\n that only matches one unique bundle identifier or a \nwildcard App ID\n that can match multiple ones.\n\n\nXcode will also create a \nTeam Provisioning Profile\n for your project automatically, so you can start deploying to your device automatically.\n\n\nIf you hit any issues you should make sure that the device is eligible, for example if the device doesn't match the deployment target you will get an error.\n\n\nAlso make sure that your app is connected to the correct Team.\n\n\n\n\nSelect your project file from Xcode's project navigator\n\n\nGo to the \nSigning\n section and under the \nTeam\n select your correct team.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you hit any issues and can't resolve it move to the manual step and set up Provisioning Profiles according to the documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nTo setup a distribution Provisioning Profile go ahead with the manual setup.\n\n\n\n\nDownload a Provisioning Profile with Xcode\n\n\nIf you have already created the Provisioning Profile, you can do the following.\n\n\n\n\nStart Xcode\n\n\nSelect Xcode \n Preferences from the navigation bar.\n\n\nAt the top of the window select \nAccounts\n.\n\n\nSelect your Apple ID and your team from the right side bar, then click on \nView Details...\n.\n\n\nA dialog will appear where you will see your code signing identities and the provisioning profiles.\n\n\nUnder Provisioning Profiles locate the ones you are looking for and click on the \nDownload\n button.
