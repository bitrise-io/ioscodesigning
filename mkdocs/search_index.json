This will create a public/private key for you if you don't have one already. Apple will then verify the information, and create a certificate for you.\n\n\nGenerate a Code Signing Certificate using Xcode\n\n\nFirst you have to add your Apple ID to Accounts preferences in Xcode. If you are already done with this, you can skip to step 6.\n\n\n\n\nStart Xcode\n\n\nSelect Xcode \n Preferences from the navigation bar.\n\n\nAt the top of the window select \nAccounts\n.\n\n\nClick on the \n+\n on the lower left corner and select \nAdd Apple ID...\n\n\n\n\nA dialog will appear.

If you have not created them you will see a \nCreate\n button next to them. Simply select it and Xcode will issue and download your code signing identities for you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nIf you already have Code Signing Identities issued, you will see a \nReset\n button next to them. You can issue new certificates with it, that Xcode will generate and download, however note that this will invalidate your previous certificate, so only do this if you've lost those files or if you know what you are doing!\n\n\n\n\nGenerate a Code Signing Certificate manually\n\n\n\n\nOpen your \nKeychain Access\n app on macOS.\n\n\nSelect \nKeychain Access\n \n \nCertificate Assistant\n \n \nRequest a Certificate From a Certificate Authority...\n\n\nFill in the \nUser's Email Address\n and the \nCommon Name\n and select \nSaved to Disk\n.

Once installed it will be added to your \nKeychain Access\n app.\n\n\n\n\nGenerate a Provisioning Profile\n\n\nProvisioning is the process of preparing and configuring an app to launch on devices and to use app services. Development Provisioning Profiles holds the device identifiers ( UUID ) that is eligible to run your app. Distribution Provisioning Profiles can include App Store profiles, that lets you distribute your app to the App Store and Ad-hoc profiles are good for distributing to your testers.\n\n\nGenerate a Provisioning Profile with Xcode\n\n\nXcode will automatically generate an App ID for your project, that matches your unique bundle ID for your project. An App ID is used to identify one or more of your apps. It can be an \nexplicit App ID\n that only matches one unique bundle identifier or a \nwildcard App ID\n that can match multiple ones.\n\n\nXcode will also create a \nTeam Provisioning Profile\n for your project automatically, so you can start deploying to your device automatically.\n\n\nIf you hit any issues you should make sure that the device is eligible, for example if the device doesn't match the deployment target you will get an error.\n\n\nAlso make sure that your app is connected to the correct Team.\n\n\n\n\nSelect your project file from Xcode's project navigator\n\n\nGo to the \nSigning\n section and under the \nTeam\n select your correct team.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you hit any issues and can't resolve it move to the manual step and set up Provisioning Profiles following the documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nTo setup a distribution Provisioning Profile, go ahead with the manual setup.\n\n\n\n\nDownload a Provisioning Profile with Xcode\n\n\nIf you have already created the Provisioning Profile, you can do the following.\n\n\n\n\nStart Xcode\n\n\nSelect Xcode \n Preferences from the navigation bar.\n\n\nAt the top of the window select \nAccounts\n.\n\n\nSelect your Apple ID and your team from the right side bar, then click on \nView Details...\n.\n\n\nA dialog will appear where you will see your code signing identities and the provisioning profiles.\n\n\nUnder Provisioning Profiles locate the ones you are looking for and click on the \nDownload\n button. Xcode will download the profile and move it to its location automatically.\n\n\n\n\nGenerate a Provisioning Profile manually\n\n\nSetup an App ID\n\n\n\n\nIf you haven't already created an App ID for your project, go to \nhttps://developer.apple.com\n and log in.\n\n\nSelect Certificates, Identifiers \n Profiles from the left sidebar\n\n\nNavigate to Identifiers \n App IDs\n\n\nIn the \nApp ID Description\n add a recognizable name for your App ID\n\n\nSelect \nExplicit App ID\n and add your bundle identifier to the field.\n\n\nSelect any additional \nApp Services\n that you need.\n\n\nClick continue.\n\n\n\n\nGenerate a Provisioning Profile\n\n\n\n\nGo to \nhttps://developer.apple.com\n and log in.\n\n\nSelect Certificates, Identifiers \n Profiles from the left sidebar\n\n\nNavigate to Provisioning Profiles \n All\n\n\nSelect the \n+\n from the top right corner.\n\n\nFor development select the correct project type under \nDevelopment\n, or for distribution select the correct one under \nDistribution\n and click continue.\n\n\nSelect the App ID you would like to use.\n\n\nSelect the certificates you wish to include in the Provisioning Profile. These certificates will be able to build with this profile; click continue.\n\n\nSelect all the devices you would like to use with this profile and click continue.\n\n\nName your Provisioning Profile and click continue.\n\n\nYour profile is generated.
