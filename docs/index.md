# iOS Code Signing
If you are developing an iOS app and you want to test it on a real device or if you want to distribute it to the App Store, you have to code sign your application. This ensures that the user can trust that your app is coming from a known and trusted source that Apple knows.

This guide was created to help iOS developers with code signing and to ease the sometimes messy process.
